GProlog-cx-1.4.1
================

This code was string-by-string applying changes from
http://www.di.uevora.pt/~spa/software/gprolog-cx_1.2.18-16.tar.gz to GNU Prolog
1.4.1 source code.

This work was done in 2012 year and now I not remember what I do and which
problems I get.

If you want to build this code with GNU Prolog then you must read
